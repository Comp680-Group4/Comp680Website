  <p style="color:darkblue">February 2, 2020: Initial Seminar Proposal Posted</p><br>
  <p style="color:black">
    User
    User behavior tracking, analytics, and all things regarding information gathering tools has been a controversial and heavily researched topic in recent years. Many large online platforms use some form of it to gather data on users, sometimes with the intent to preserve information and keep it in the hands of users through information security techniques, while others use it to share data with partners and collect data to further promote their own models. It is a widely used paradigm and is only becoming more prevalent in technology. We are proposing to research and gather information, from a software engineering standpoint, on what types of systems are commonly used in tracking user and gathering user data, both front end and back end, what kinds of techniques and strategies these systems are implemented from, and what the industry revolving around these components will look like going forward. The goal of this proposal is four-fold; first, we will present a case as to  (i) Why User Behaviour Tracking Systems are important, why the industry is and should be moving forward with creating more standardized and enforced Behaviour Tracking Methodologies, and why it is important to understand how these technologies work. Part (ii) will be a front-end look at components that are utilized to track and gather data, including how users interact with them, such as advertisements, privacy policies, and online and mobile applications. Part (iii) will involve a back-end deep dive into the technologies and methodologies utilized, such as cookies, big data handling capabilities, machine learning algorithms to analyze and assess deviations from normal user behaviour, and entity behaviour tracking capabilities. Part (iv) will be an in-depth look at what user behaviour tracking technologies will likely look like going forward, and will detail many of the ethical conversations surrounding these technologies and how prominent they should be.
    Our proposed seminar presentation outline will follow suit; below are the topics that will be covered along with references for the resources we will utilize in our research.
